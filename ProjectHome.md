Expose manages the files open in Netbeans, allowing the developer to quickly locate editors and close many editors at once. Files are presented in a table with sortable columns Name, (mime) Type, Project, Modified time, and last shown (Exposed) time. For example, to close all the diff views, click on the type column to sort by type, drag out to select all the "diff" types, then right-click "close." I keep this docked on the left next to my swing-out Navigator Tab, and use it all the time. The name expose is based on the Mac "Expose" feature, which helps the user sort through a pile of open windows.
